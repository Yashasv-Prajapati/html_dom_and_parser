# Custom HTML Parser and DOM manipulator
1. What is done?
    - A custom HTML parser is implemented in C++. It is able to parse HTML files and create a DOM tree.
    - The parsing is not perfect and may not work for all HTML files. It is basic parsing for building the DOM tree.

2. What is next?
    - The DOM tree can be manipulated to add, remove, or modify elements. This will be implemented in a separate class.
    - Create a custom HTML generator to generate HTML files from the DOM tree.
    - Create several DOM functions to manipulate the DOM tree.
